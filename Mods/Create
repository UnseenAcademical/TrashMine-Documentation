Create is a mod that uses actual gearing and physical force to do complex automation.

There's very little how-to on it, so this is based on my own personal ideas.

To start with, you'll need andesite and iron nuggets to make andesite alloy bars. Then, you can use these bars with wood and a few other things to craft gears. This will open up your ability to craft a water wheel or a windmill.

Water wheels generate rotational force if there's flowing water blocks around them. Windmills generate force from the amount of blocks of wool attached to the fence posts projecting off the central hub.

Your next priority will probably be a mixer, as it's the most efficient way to make brass. Mixers require fast speeds, so you'll have to use large and small gears to turn torque into speed.

Use a lever to deactivate the mixer, put the ingredients in a basin underneath it, and then throw the switch to make it mix up whatever set of things you've put in.
